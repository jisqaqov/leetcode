/**
 * Given a set of products that are in the same category, segregate the products
 * as per their categories, or return the products as per their category.
 *
 * Input : { {1,2}, {2,3}, {4,5}}
 * Here 1 and 2 are in the same product category, 2 and 3 are also in the same category and similar for 4,5.
 *
 * The expected output : {{1,2,3}, {4,5}) -> 1,2,3 are in the same category as explained above,
 * 4,5 are in a different product category.
 *
 * One more example :
 * Input : {{1,2}, {3,4}, {6,7}, {4,5}, {6,5}}
 * Output: {{1,2}, {3,4,5,6,7}}
